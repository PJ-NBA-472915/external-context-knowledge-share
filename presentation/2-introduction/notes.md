- I am tracking research and knowledge in this area on this repo.
- Current focus is what I am curious about and currently spending time on learning.
- The two points that are particularly relevant to the knowledge share is knowledge (what the agent knows and focuses on)
- and Rules (methods and recipes about how it does the work that it must follow)
- And then we'll close and I'll thank you.
