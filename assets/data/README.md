# Data Directory

This directory contains datasets, research data, and experimental results used throughout the knowledge-share repository.

## Purpose

The `assets/data/` directory serves as a central repository for:
- Raw experimental data
- Benchmark results
- Performance measurements
- Research datasets
- Configuration files used in experiments

## Directory Structure

```
assets/data/
├── README.md                    # This file
├── experiments/                 # Data from specific experiments
│   ├── locking-mechanism/      # Locking mechanism test results
│   ├── performance-benchmarks/ # Performance test data
│   └── failure-analysis/       # Failure mode analysis data
├── research/                    # Research datasets and findings
│   ├── state-management/       # State management research data
│   └── distributed-systems/    # Distributed system research data
└── templates/                   # Data collection templates
    ├── experiment-data.csv     # Standard experiment data format
    └── results-template.json   # Results documentation template
```

## Data Storage Conventions

### File Naming
- Use descriptive, lowercase names with hyphens
- Include date stamps for time-sensitive data: `YYYY-MM-DD-experiment-name.csv`
- Group related data in subdirectories by experiment or research area

### File Formats
- **CSV**: For tabular data, time series, and measurements
- **JSON**: For structured data, configuration files, and results
- **YAML**: For configuration and metadata
- **TXT**: For log files and unstructured text data

### Required Documentation
Each dataset must include:
1. **README.md**: Explaining the data source, format, and usage
2. **Metadata file**: Describing columns, units, and data types
3. **Collection method**: How the data was gathered
4. **Timestamp**: When the data was collected
5. **Version**: Data version or iteration number

## Example Dataset Structure

```
assets/data/experiments/locking-mechanism/
├── README.md                    # Experiment overview and methodology
├── metadata.yaml               # Data schema and column descriptions
├── 2025-08-27-baseline-test.csv # Raw test results
├── 2025-08-27-baseline-test-results.json # Processed results
└── analysis/                   # Analysis scripts and outputs
    ├── performance-analysis.py
    └── results-visualisation.py
```

## Data Quality Standards

### Validation
- [ ] Data is complete and consistent
- [ ] Missing values are clearly marked
- [ ] Units and measurements are documented
- [ ] Data collection methodology is reproducible
- [ ] Results can be independently verified

### Documentation
- [ ] Clear description of what the data represents
- [ ] Explanation of how to interpret results
- [ ] Known limitations or caveats
- [ ] References to related research or experiments
- [ ] Instructions for reproducing the data collection

## Usage Guidelines

### For Contributors
1. **Store raw data** in appropriate subdirectories
2. **Document everything** - assume others will need to understand your data
3. **Use consistent formats** for similar types of data
4. **Include analysis scripts** when possible
5. **Update this README** when adding new data types

### For Readers
1. **Check the README** in each data subdirectory
2. **Review metadata** to understand data structure
3. **Follow analysis scripts** to reproduce results
4. **Cite data sources** when using in your own work
5. **Report issues** with data quality or documentation

## Templates

### Experiment Data Template
Use `templates/experiment-data.csv` for consistent data collection:
- Standard column headers for common measurements
- Predefined data types and units
- Required fields for reproducibility

### Results Template
Use `templates/results-template.json` for documenting experiment outcomes:
- Structured format for key findings
- Metadata about experimental conditions
- Links to raw data and analysis scripts

## Best Practices

1. **Keep data current**: Update datasets when new information becomes available
2. **Version control**: Use meaningful version numbers for significant changes
3. **Backup important data**: Ensure critical datasets are safely stored
4. **Cross-reference**: Link data to related research notes and experiments
5. **Validate regularly**: Check data integrity and update documentation as needed
