### Content Flow
Session builds from basic concepts to practical application, with hands-on exercises to reinforce learning.

## Key Points

### What is External Context Management?
- **Concept**: Centralised storage for shared knowledge and state
- **Example**: Multiple AI agents sharing research findings
- **Why it matters**: Prevents redundant work and enables collaboration

### Architecture Patterns
- **Concept**: Different ways to implement context sharing
- **Example**: Redis-based centralised store vs. distributed sync
- **Why it matters**: Choice affects performance, consistency, and complexity

### Implementation Considerations
- **Concept**: Key factors to consider when designing systems
- **Example**: Locking mechanisms, consistency models, storage backends
- **Why it matters**: Poor choices can lead to data corruption or poor performance

## Interactive Elements

### Exercise 1: Context Sharing Simulation
**Purpose**: Demonstrate why external context management is needed

**Instructions**:
1. Participants work in pairs
2. Each pair has a shared "knowledge base" (piece of paper)
3. Both participants try to update the knowledge base simultaneously
4. Observe what happens without coordination

**Discussion Points**:
- What problems did you encounter?
- How could you solve these problems?
- What would happen with more participants?

### Exercise 2: Pattern Selection
**Purpose**: Practice choosing appropriate architectures

**Instructions**:
1. Read through three different use case scenarios
2. For each scenario, choose between centralised and distributed approaches
3. Justify your choice based on requirements
4. Discuss trade-offs with the group

**Discussion Points**:
- What factors influenced your decision?
- What are the trade-offs of each approach?
- How would you handle failure scenarios?

## Visual Aids

### Slides
- **Slide 1**: Session overview and objectives
- **Slide 2**: What is external context management?
- **Slide 3**: Architecture patterns comparison
- **Slide 4**: Implementation considerations

### Diagrams
- **Architecture Diagram**: Shows centralised vs. distributed patterns
- **Timeline Diagram**: Illustrates context sharing over time

### Code Examples
- **Simple Context Store**: Basic Redis implementation
- **Locking Example**: How to implement proper locking

## Q&A Preparation

### Anticipated Questions
Common questions and prepared answers:

**Q: How does this differ from a regular database?**
A: External context management is specifically designed for agent-to-agent communication and knowledge sharing, with features like locking, versioning, and conflict resolution built-in.

**Q: What's the performance impact?**
A: Based on our experiments, the overhead is typically 10-15% compared to local context, which is acceptable for most applications given the benefits.

### Discussion Starters
Questions to encourage participation and deeper thinking:

1. What problems have you encountered with knowledge sharing in your systems?
2. How do you currently handle state management across multiple processes?
3. What would be the biggest challenges in implementing this in your environment?

## Resources

### Pre-Session Reading
- [Repository Overview](../../00-introduction/README.md): Basic repository structure
- [External Context Management Concept](../../10-concepts/external-context-management.md): Core concepts

### During Session
- **Interactive Demos**: Live demonstrations of context sharing
- **Code Examples**: Working examples to explore

### Post-Session Follow-up
- [Locking Mechanism Tests](../../30-experiments/locking-mechanism-tests.md): Practical implementation details
- [Research Notes](../../20-research/): Deeper technical analysis

## Assessment

### Understanding Checks
How to gauge whether participants are following along:

- **Exercise Participation**: Are participants actively engaging in exercises?
- **Question Quality**: Are participants asking relevant, thoughtful questions?
- **Discussion Contribution**: Are participants sharing relevant experiences?

### Success Indicators
Signs that the session is achieving its objectives:

- Participants can explain external context management in their own words
- Participants can identify appropriate use cases for the technology
- Participants understand the trade-offs between different approaches

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
Potential problems and how to handle them:

**Issue**: Participants struggle with the concept
**Solution**: Use more concrete examples and real-world analogies

**Issue**: Technical discussion goes too deep
**Solution**: Redirect to high-level concepts and save details for follow-up

### Time Management
How to adjust if the session runs long or short:

- **If running long**: Skip the second exercise and focus on Q&A
- **If running short**: Add more discussion time and encourage deeper exploration

## Follow-up

### Next Steps
What participants should do after the session:

1. **Review the concepts**: Re-read the core concept document
2. **Explore examples**: Look at the experiment results and code
3. **Identify opportunities**: Look for use cases in their own work
4. **Join discussions**: Participate in follow-up knowledge sharing

### Further Learning
Resources for continued exploration:

- **Advanced Patterns**: Multi-agent workflows and knowledge sharing patterns
- **Practical Implementation**: Locking mechanism tests and performance benchmarks
- **Research**: State management approaches and distributed system patterns

### Feedback Collection
