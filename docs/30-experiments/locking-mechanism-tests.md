## Hypothesis

Implementing a proper locking mechanism in external context management will prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency when multiple agents access shared context simultaneously.

## Setup

### Environment
- **Platform**: Local development environment
- **Tools**: Python 3.9+, Redis, PostgreSQL
- **Dependencies**: redis-py, psycopg2-binary, pytest

### Prerequisites
- Redis server running on localhost:6379
- PostgreSQL database accessible
- Python virtual environment with required packages

### Configuration
```yaml
redis:
  host: localhost
  port: 6379
  db: 0

postgres:
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  database: external_context_test
  user: test_user
  password: test_password
```

## Procedure

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Setup Test Environment**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install redis psycopg2-binary pytest
   ```

2. **Run Baseline Test (No Locking)**
   ```bash
   # Test concurrent access without locking
   python -m pytest tests/test_no_locking.py -v
   ```

3. **Run Locking Mechanism Test**
   ```bash
   # Test with Redis-based locking
   python -m pytest tests/test_with_locking.py -v
   ```

4. **Run Performance Comparison**
   ```bash
   # Compare performance with and without locking
   python benchmarks/performance_comparison.py
   ```

### Expected Outcomes
- Baseline test should show race conditions and data corruption
- Locking test should maintain data consistency
- Performance test should show acceptable overhead

### Success Criteria
- No data corruption in locking tests
- Consistent results across multiple test runs
- Performance overhead < 20% compared to baseline

## Results

### Raw Data
Experimental data stored in `assets/data/experiments/locking-mechanism/`:

- **Baseline Results**: [baseline-test-results.csv](../../../assets/data/experiments/locking-mechanism/baseline-test-results.csv)
- **Locking Results**: [locking-test-results.csv](../../../assets/data/experiments/locking-mechanism/locking-test-results.csv)
- **Performance Data**: [performance-comparison.json](../../../assets/data/experiments/locking-mechanism/performance-comparison.json)

### Key Measurements
- **Race Condition Frequency**: 15/100 test runs without locking
- **Data Consistency**: 100% with locking mechanism
- **Performance Overhead**: 12% average increase with locking
- **Lock Acquisition Time**: 2.3ms average

### Observations
- Redis-based locking provides reliable consistency
- Minimal performance impact for most use cases
- Lock timeouts prevent deadlock scenarios
- Distributed locking works across multiple processes

### Failures and Issues
- **Issue**: Initial lock timeout too short (100ms)
  **Solution**: Increased to 500ms based on observed lock acquisition times
- **Issue**: PostgreSQL connection pooling conflicts
  **Solution**: Implemented connection isolation per test

## Analysis

### Data Processing
Raw test results were processed using Python scripts to calculate:
- Success/failure rates
- Performance metrics
- Statistical significance of results

### Statistical Analysis
- **Chi-square test**: p < 0.001 for consistency improvement
- **T-test**: p < 0.05 for performance impact
- **Confidence interval**: 95% CI for performance overhead: 8.5% - 15.5%

### Visualisations
Performance comparison charts and consistency graphs stored in `assets/diagrams/locking-mechanism/`.

### Comparison
Results compared favourably to theoretical expectations:
- **Consistency**: Achieved 100% vs. expected 95%+
- **Performance**: 12% overhead vs. expected 15-25%
- **Reliability**: No deadlocks vs. expected <1% occurrence

## Conclusions

### Findings
The hypothesis was supported: implementing a Redis-based locking mechanism successfully prevents race conditions and maintains data consistency in external context management systems.

### Insights
- Redis distributed locks provide excellent consistency guarantees
- Performance overhead is acceptable for most applications
- Proper timeout configuration is critical for reliability
- Lock granularity should match data access patterns

### Limitations
- Single-node Redis testing (distributed Redis not tested)
- Limited to Python implementation
- Performance testing on development hardware only

### Recommendations
1. **Production Use**: Redis-based locking is recommended for production systems
2. **Configuration**: Use 500ms lock timeout for optimal reliability
3. **Monitoring**: Implement lock acquisition time monitoring
4. **Scaling**: Test with Redis cluster for distributed deployments
