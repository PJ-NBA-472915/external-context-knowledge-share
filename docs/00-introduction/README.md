# Repository Overview

Welcome to the Knowledge Share repository for External Context Management. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding, researching, and implementing external context management systems.

## What is External Context Management?

External Context Management refers to the practice of maintaining and sharing state, knowledge, and context across multiple AI agents, systems, or processes. Instead of each agent maintaining its own isolated context, external context management provides a centralised, persistent, and shareable knowledge base.

## Why This Matters

In multi-agent systems, knowledge sharing and context persistence are critical for:
- **Efficiency**: Avoiding redundant work and knowledge discovery
- **Consistency**: Ensuring all agents work with the same information
- **Collaboration**: Enabling agents to build upon each other's work
- **Learning**: Creating a persistent knowledge base that improves over time

## Repository Structure

This repository is organised to support both learning and research:

- **Concepts**: Core theoretical understanding
- **Research**: In-depth analysis and findings
- **Experiments**: Practical implementations and tests
- **Session Guides**: How to present and teach these concepts

## Getting Started

1. **Read the concepts** in the [10-concepts](../10-concepts/) section
2. **Explore research** in the [20-research](../20-research/) section
3. **Run experiments** from the [30-experiments](../30-experiments/) section
4. **Use session guides** from the [40-session-guides](../40-session-guides/) section

## Key Principles

- **Markdown-first**: All content is written in Markdown for maximum compatibility
- **Reproducible**: Experiments and research can be independently verified
- **Navigable**: Clear structure and links for easy navigation
- **Extensible**: Templates and conventions for adding new content
