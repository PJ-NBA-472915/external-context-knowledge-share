## Abstract

This research note examines the evolution from generic text-based retrieval to sophisticated, code-aware strategies that leverage the inherent structure and semantics of source code. The analysis covers AST-aware chunking methods, graph-based retrieval approaches, and the emerging discipline of "context engineering" that treats context assembly as a core engineering task.

## Background

Providing an AI agent with access to a memory store is only the first step; the quality of the agent's output is critically dependent on the relevance and coherence of the information retrieved from that memory. When the memory consists of a software repository, treating code as simple plain text is insufficient. Code has inherent structure, syntax, and relational semantics that must be respected to achieve high-fidelity context retrieval.

This challenge has spurred a maturation of practice in the industry, moving beyond the ad-hoc tweaking of prompts to a more systematic discipline known as "context engineering." This paradigm treats the entire process of assembling the context for an LLM as a core engineering task, encompassing strategic retrieval of information from knowledge bases, the use of structured templates, and the design of interactive workflows.

## Beyond Semantic Search: The Imperative for Structural Awareness

### Limitations of Traditional RAG

Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines often rely on generic text-splitting techniques, such as fixed-size or recursive character-based chunking. While effective for prose, these methods are poorly suited for source code. Naive chunking frequently breaks apart syntactically meaningful units—splitting a function in the middle of its body, separating a class from its methods, or isolating an import statement from its usage—thereby destroying the local context essential for comprehension.

This loss of structural integrity degrades the quality of the retrieved context and, consequently, the accuracy of the code generated by the LLM. The industry is moving beyond simple "prompt engineering" to a more disciplined practice of "context engineering" that invests in data pipelines capable of intelligently processing and indexing codebases.

## AST-Aware Chunking Methods

### The cAST Approach

To address the shortcomings of naive chunking, researchers have developed methods that leverage the inherent structure of code. The most promising of these are techniques that use the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), a hierarchical representation of a program's syntactic structure.

A state-of-the-art method in this area is cAST (chunking via Abstract Syntax Trees), detailed in a June 2025 paper by Zhang et al. Instead of splitting text based on line or character counts, cAST uses the AST to guide the chunking process, ensuring "syntactic integrity."

#### cAST Process

The cAST process works via a recursive "split-then-merge" algorithm:

1. **Parsing**: The source code is first parsed into an AST using a language-agnostic parser like tree-sitter
2. **Traversal**: The algorithm traverses the tree, attempting to fit entire syntactic nodes (such as a function definition or a class block) into a single chunk, respecting a pre-defined size budget
3. **Recursive Splitting**: If a node is too large to fit, it is recursively split into its constituent sub-nodes
4. **Greedy Merging**: To avoid creating too many small, fragmented chunks, adjacent small sibling nodes are combined into a single chunk, maximizing information density while preserving syntactic boundaries

#### Benefits and Performance

This approach produces chunks that are self-contained and semantically coherent. Empirical evaluations have shown that using cAST significantly improves performance on downstream code generation and retrieval tasks:

- **RepoEval retrieval benchmark**: Boosted Recall@5 by 4.3 points
- **SWE-bench code generation benchmark**: Improved the Pass@1 rate by 2.67 points
- **Cross-language consistency**: The same chunking strategy applied to Python, Java, etc., yielding gains up to +4.3 on CrossCodeEval tests

### Implementation Considerations

AST-aware chunking requires:
- Language-specific parsers (tree-sitter is commonly used)
- Careful handling of different programming language constructs
- Balancing chunk size with syntactic completeness
- Efficient AST traversal algorithms

## Graph-Based Retrieval and Multi-Hop Reasoning

### Knowledge Graph Representation

While AST-aware chunking improves the quality of individual units that can be retrieved, understanding a codebase often requires comprehending the relationships between these units. This is where graph-based retrieval methods excel. By representing a codebase as a knowledge graph—with nodes for entities like files, classes, and functions, and edges for relationships like calls, imports, and inherits—agents can perform sophisticated, multi-hop reasoning that is impossible with standard vector search.

### LocAgent Framework

Frameworks like LocAgent are designed to leverage such representations. They equip an LLM agent with a set of tools for navigating the code graph:

- **SearchEntity**: To find initial code entities based on keywords
- **TraverseGraph**: To explore the relationships of an entity (e.g., find all functions that call it) in a multi-hop fashion
- **RetrieveEntity**: To get the full code content of a specific entity

This allows the agent to trace dependencies and build a comprehensive picture of how a piece of code fits into the larger system, mirroring the investigative process of a human developer.

### Hybrid Search Strategies

The most effective systems often employ a hybrid search strategy:

1. **Initial Vector Search**: An initial user query is used to perform a vector search over code chunks to find the most semantically relevant starting points
2. **Graph Traversal**: The agent then uses graph traversal tools to explore the local neighborhood of these seed nodes
3. **Context Assembly**: A final, rich context is assembled that combines both semantic similarity and structural dependency information

This multi-stage, hybrid process represents a significant evolution from the simple "retrieve-then-generate" pipeline, enabling much deeper and more accurate context assembly.

## Context Engineering in Practice

### The Dual-Context Approach

A powerful example of context engineering in practice is the dual-context approach for AI coding assistants. Instead of relying on the AI to infer everything from the code, developers provide two explicit context files:

1. **project-context.md**: A Markdown file that acts as a project blueprint, detailing:
   - Overall architecture
   - Tech stack (e.g., Java, Spring Boot, AWS)
   - Folder structure
   - Development practices (e.g., API design, security protocols)

2. **Role-Based System Prompt**: A separate file (e.g., software-engineer.md) that defines the "persona" for the AI:
   - User's role (e.g., "Senior Software Engineer")
   - Coding style preferences (e.g., kebab-case for routes)
   - Constraints (e.g., only use approved libraries like Spring Security)

By feeding both documents to an agent like the GitHub Copilot Agent, developers can significantly reduce context misalignment and iterative overhead, ensuring the generated code aligns with professional standards from the start.

### Context Assembly Workflows

Advanced context engineering involves creating intelligent workflows for context assembly:

- **Multi-chunk retrieval**: Instead of feeding the top-1 relevant document, systems retrieve multiple relevant snippets and then assemble or fuse them
- **Procedural retrieval planning**: An agent might first retrieve a high-level document (like a README), then based on that, decide to retrieve a specific code snippet, and so on
- **Incremental context building**: Context is built step-by-step, with each retrieval informing the next

## Performance and Trade-offs

### Retrieval Quality Metrics

The effectiveness of code-aware retrieval strategies is measured through several metrics:

- **Recall@K**: The proportion of relevant documents found in the top K results
- **Pass@1**: The success rate of code generation tasks
- **Context coherence**: The semantic consistency of assembled context
- **Retrieval latency**: The time required to assemble context

### Trade-offs and Considerations

Code-aware retrieval introduces several trade-offs:

1. **Setup Complexity vs. Retrieval Quality**: Graph-based approaches require more initial setup but provide richer context
2. **Retrieval Speed vs. Context Depth**: Multi-hop reasoning provides deeper context but increases latency
3. **Language Support vs. Generality**: AST-aware methods work best with well-supported languages
4. **Memory Usage vs. Retrieval Accuracy**: Storing graph representations requires more memory but enables more sophisticated queries

## Industry Adoption and Tools
